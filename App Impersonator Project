--For this project, I downloaded data from Kaggle on Amazon's Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009-2019. 
--I then created a table to store the data and inserted a few example rows of what this data looks like. I am not inputting all of the data, just a few rows for this project specifically. 
--Then I used an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app. As well as a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.

--Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE Top50Books_2009_2019 (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
name TEXT, 
author TEXT, 
user_rating INTEGER, 
reviews INTEGER, 
price INTEGER, 
year INTEGER, 
genre TEXT);
