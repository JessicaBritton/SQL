--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data on the top 50 songs in 2021 from Kaggle.
--I created a table in SQLite Studio to insert the Spotify data into.
--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
--I explored the data and used SQL to answer some questions I had.
--At the bottom is also a description of the 14 variables about the songs.

--Here is the table:

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Below are the questions with the SQL I used to get the results I was looking for:



--Description of the data in each column:
--Popularity - The higher the value the more popular the song is
--Danceability - The higher the value, the easier it is to dance to this song
--Energy - The energy of a song - the higher the value, the more energtic. song
--Key - the key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1 (range: -1; 11)
--Loudness (dB) - The higher the value, the louder the song
--Mode - indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0
--Speechiness - The higher the value the more spoken word the song contains
--Acousticness - The higher the value the more acoustic the song is
--Instrumentalness - the number of vocals in a song. The closer the value to 1.0, the more instrumental the song is
--Liveness - The higher the value, the more likely the song is a live recording
--Valence - The higher the value, the more positive mood for the song
--Tempo - the overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM)
--Duration - duration of the song in ms
--Time signature - an estimated time signature. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). The time signature ranges from 3 to 7 indicating time signatures of "3/4", to "7/4"
