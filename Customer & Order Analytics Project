#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

-- 1. How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT ORDERID) AS JAN_ORDERS

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
