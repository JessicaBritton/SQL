#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--#1.How many orders were placed in January? (Remember to filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs)

SELECT COUNT( orderID ) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderId) = 6
AND orderId <> 'Order ID';

--#2.How many of those orders were for an iphone?

SELECT COUNT( orderID ) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderId) = 6
AND orderId <> 'Order ID';

--#3.Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customer
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON customer.order_ID=Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--#4.Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? (I have two correct answers listed below.)

SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price) AS Cheapest_Price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--#5.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product;

--#6.Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_ID
WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

--#9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT distinct location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%NY%'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
Having COUNT(orderID) >= 3;

--#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity_Sold
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%headphones%'
GROUP BY Product;

--#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT SUM(Quantity*price)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) AS AVG_AmountSpent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 

SELECT SUM(Quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) AS AVG_QuantityPurchased
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity*price) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Revenue desc
