For this Project, I created a database with three tables that were related to each other. 
The first table had to be a small set of "Famous People", and the other 
tables were things that they do or were related to them in someway. 
I then came up with SQL code to query the data and answer questions about the data.


CREATE TABLE Famous_People 
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
    fullname TEXT,
    birthdate TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO Famous_People (fullname, birthdate) VALUES ("Vin Diesel", "1967-07-18");

--ANALYSIS:

--1. In the two queries below I am seecting all the data from 'Famous People' and 'Movies'.
SELECT 
    * 
FROM 
    FAMOUS_PEOPLE;

SELECT 
    * 
FROM 
    MOVIES;

--2. What movies have each actor appeared in?
SELECT 
    FAMOUS_PEOPLE.FULLNAME AS ACTOR,
    MOVIES.TITLE AS MOVIE_TITLE
FROM 
    FAMOUS_PEOPLE
JOIN 
    MOVIES
    ON FAMOUS_PEOPLE.ID = MOVIES.ACTOR_ID;

--3. Display the movie title and the two actors who are the 'love interest' in the movie.
SELECT 
    A.FULLNAME AS LOVE_INTEREST_A, 
    B.FULLNAME AS LOVE_INTEREST_B,
    MOVIES.TITLE AS MOVIE_TITLE
FROM 
    MOVIE_LOVE_INTEREST
JOIN 
    FAMOUS_PEOPLE AS A
    ON MOVIE_LOVE_INTEREST.ACTOR1_ID = A.ID
