/*For this project, I am working with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers(as well as a few others). 
I am querying some questions that I had about this dataset. Below are the questions and it's SQL.*/

Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

--#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

--#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName,

LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId;

--#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
